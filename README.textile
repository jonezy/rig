h1. rig

rig is a rakefile that I use in my day to day work as a .net developer.  Strange I know, but the rake framework is actually far superior to any .net tool i've found for automating building, cleanup and simple deployment needs.

at this point it's very very simple, there are 2 things you can do with it:

h3. rake build

h3. rake package:deploy['ProjectName']
